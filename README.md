# Fabio Vitalba - Ship Navigation Project ('Boil Voyage')
This is the final project for the course "Physical Computing Project 24/25" for Fabio Vitalba

## Boil Voyage
The Project is divided into two repositories. This repository is the 3D world created using Unity.
The 3D world allows players to control a ship through a set of islands and ports.
Find the other repository here: [Arduino Water Boiler Controller](https://github.com/fabiovitalba/PCP-Water-Boiler-Controller).

## 1. Description
In this Unity 3D project, you will find a navigateable ship that can sail accross the ocean between some islands. The ship has the ability to accelerate or decelerate as well as to steer/rudder, based on input. Whenever the ship is near to a port, that port is stored as a checkpoint in case the ship goes on land.
Each major island hosts a small village together with a port. A couple of shipwrecks can be found while navigating.

## 3. Installation
This Project requires some external assets from the Unity Asset Store. By opening this project through the Unity Hub, it will automatically download any required assets and build it in order to be run.

### 3.1. Fine tuning of Arduino Controller
When using the **Arduino Water Boiler Controller** you might have to fine tune some settings inside the 3D world. Here are the most important settings to look at:


## 4. Usage
The project was only tested inside Unity 3D, so you will have to open the repository from there in order to access and run the project.

### 4.1. Controls
#### 4.1.1. Keybinds (Keyboard)
- `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` in order to move the ship.
- `Q`, `E` allow the user to tilt the camera to the left or the right.
- `SPACE`/` ` in order to activate the searchlights attached to the ship.

#### 4.1.2. Keybinds (Arduino Water Boiler)
- Rotate the Boiler to the left or the right in order to steer the ship.
- Lift or drop the Boiler's lid in order to accelerate more or less.
- Press the button on the Boiler in order to activate the searchlights attached to the ship.

## 5. Support
For issues feel free to contact me on fvitalba@unibz.it, or by opening an Issue on the Repository.

## 6. Contributing
Currently this project is not open for contributions at it is in very early stages of development.
